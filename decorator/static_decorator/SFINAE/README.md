# Substitution Failure Is Not An Error (SFINAE)
+ Basic idea:
    - ***Avoid compiler issues by using an alternativ overload of a function***
+ SFINAE is a predecessor to C++20 concepts and some kind of meta-programming
    - But just some kind of. C++ concepts and SFINAE methods can coexist in your code. Not all SFINAE techniques are fully covered by C++ concepts
