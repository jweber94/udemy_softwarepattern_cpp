# Flyweight
+ *The flyweight is a structural design pattern that is used to do memory space optimization!*
	- The aim is to avoid redundancy when storing data in the RAM
+ ***A flyweight is a space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects***
	- Store data externally and reference to this data when you need it
