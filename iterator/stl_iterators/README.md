# STL Iterators Overview
+ Basic Ideas behind C++ STL iterators
	- The increment (`it++`) and decrement (`it--`) operators realize the idea of advancement/regress the iterator objects
		* That explains why revserse iterators go from back to front of the iterator with the `it++` operator - we just advance the revserse iterator
