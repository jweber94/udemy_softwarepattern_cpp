# Observer Pattern
+ The Observer Pattern: An _observer_ is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. The entity generating the events is an _observable_.

## Basics
+ The observer pattern is a behavioural pattern
+ It is about notifying instances if something happens to other instances
+ We define some things at the observable that can happen and when they happen, the subscribers to that event will get notified
	- We want to get immediatly notified on all subscribed instances, when something happens

## Terminology
+ Three main terms are used in order to describe the oberserver pattern:
	- Event-Subscriber Pattern
	- Signal-Slot
	- Observer-Pattern
