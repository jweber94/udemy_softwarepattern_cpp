# Open Close Principle
+ Basic statement:
	- "Code should be open to extension but closed to modification"
	- ***This is commonly done via extension by inheritance --> We want to inherit and implement instead of modifying an existing class implementation***
+ We do not want to read and adjust existing code! We want to exte
nd the functionallity by our own implementation
+ Therefore we want to avoid to jump/read code that we have already written in order to extend its functionallity --> Therefore we do not need to worry about "_Can I add this code here?_"

## Open Close principle explained by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern](_Specification Pattern_)
