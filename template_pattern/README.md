# Template Pattern
+ We also want to deliver a high level blueprint of an algorithm but instead of defining the processing steps as a separate class, we enforce the implementation of some methods by inheritance and defining the processing by the derived class

## Basic Implemenataion Approach
+ Implement the meta algorithm within a base class
+ Inherit from the base class to define the concrete processing steps of the (within the base class) meta algorithm
